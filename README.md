# PyTorch Basics
This repo contains basics of PyTorch's tensors and different architechtures applied in PyTorch, one concept at a time. It is part of all the topics covered in [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/free-deep-learning-with-pytorch-live-course/) and inspired from [this](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial) repo.
